  Output: 'Welcome! In this first assignment, we''ll be learning about how to navigate R (and RStudio.)'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'You can use R to do spreadsheet-style table manipulation (like Excel), as well as statistics (like SPSS).'

- Class: text
  Output: 'While it takes a little bit more time to get the hang of using R, we hope you''ll find it rewarding, and choose to use it in your future research!'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'In this assignment, we will learn how to load in a data file, inspect the data, and do some brief calculations on that data.'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'First we want to tell R where to find the data files we''ll be using.'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Ask R "what is the current working directory?" by calling the function getwd()'
  CorrectAnswer: getwd()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'getwd()')
  Hint: Type getwd() into your console, and press Enter to run it and see what it tells you.

- Class: text
  Output: 'You should see a file path as the output of getwd(). This tells you the folder on your computer that R is currently "inside".'

- Class: text
  Output: 'Before working with data, we need to read it into R''s environment.'

- Class: text
  Output: First, make sure you know where the dataset is saved. It should be in the your current working directory, and saved in .csv format.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Ask R to show you all the files in your current working directory by calling the function list.files()
  CorrectAnswer: list.files()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'list.files()')
  Hint: Type list.files() into your console, and press Enter to run it and see what it tells you.

- Class: text
  Output: 'You should see a series of file names in the output. Make sure there is a file that ends in .csv, as that''s the data file we''ll be loading.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'We''ll use the function read.csv() to read data from this CSV file into R.'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'We need to tell read.csv() which file we want to read data from. We will do this by putting the name of the file inside the parentheses of read.csv() so that it knows where to look for the data.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'We also need to tell R to store the info from the file in an R object so we can work with the data.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'We''ll do this using the left-arrow operator, <- , to take the data on the RIGHT side, and save it into the label name on the LEFT side.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'Then, whenever we want to access the data, we just need to tell R the label name and the data will be there.'

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Read this CSV data file into R by entering the following command: TDM <- read.csv("classdata_2017.csv")'
  CorrectAnswer: TDM <- read.csv("classdata_2017.csv")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'TDM <- read.csv("classdata_2017.csv")')
  Hint: 'Copy the following command and press Enter to run: TDM <- read.csv("classdata_2017.csv")'

- Class: text
  Output: 'We just read in the data saved in classdata_2017.csv, and used the left arrow <- to assign that data to the label TDM.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'R is case sensitive, so the label tdm is not the same as the label TDM.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'Our convention will be to label data frames with capital letters, and variables in lowercase.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'Next, we''ll learn about functions that help you explore your data. Sometimes, you''ll use these to make sure your data read in correctly, and sometimes you''ll use these simply to inspect your data so you know what''s in it.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'The first exploring function you''ll use is str().'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'str() tells you the following things about an object:'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'the type of object that TDM is'

- Class: text
  Output: 'the number of observations and number of variables (dimensions) of TDM'

- Class: text

- Class: text
  Output: 'Now that we''ve explored the whole dataframe TDM, let''s look more closely at some of the columns contained in TDM.'

- Class: text
  Output: Accessing individual pieces of a larger dataframe, whether it be rows, columns, or single values, is called INDEXING.

- Class: text
  Output: 'To index a column in a dataframe, we can''t just type the name of the column. We need to pull the column out of the dataframe it''s in, using a $.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'For example, to look at the age column in TDM, we need to type the following: TDM$age'

- Class: text
  Output: In R, you use the $ as you would the / for webpages within a website, or file paths on a computer. It allows you to index a column that's stored inside of a dataframe.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Call summary() on a factor column in TDM and inspect the output.'
  CorrectAnswer: summary(TDM$age)
  AnswerTests: expr_uses_func('summary'); result_has_type('integer')
  Hint: 'Enter hist(TDM$...), where ... is the name of your factor column in TDM, into console and press Enter.  If you are not sure which columns are factor, enter str(TDM) and inspect the output for columns that say "Factor".'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'Now, let''s find specific descriptive statistics about specific columns in our data.'

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Use the function mean() to find the mean age of students in the dataframe.'
  CorrectAnswer: mean(TDM$age)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'mean(TDM$age)')
  Hint: 'Call the function mean() on the age column in TDM by entering the following into console: mean(TDM$age)'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'Why does it say NA? This means "not available." R is telling you it can''t compute a mean. This happens when you have one or more missing values.'

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Look at the full contents of the age column of TDM in console to see if there is missing data in the column.
  CorrectAnswer: TDM$age
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'TDM$age')
  Hint: To output the full contents of the age column to console, index the column from TDM by entering TDM$age into console.
  
- Class: text
  Output: You should see that a couple values in TDM$age are not numbers, but NA. This means that, for whatever reason in this data, some subjects have missing age data. Rats!
  
- Class: text
  Output: mean(), and many other functions, will not compute if they see missing values (NA). But you can tell them to ignore missing values and compute using the rest of the data.
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'Inside of mean(), the argument na.rm = TRUE will tell mean() to throw out missing values and compute using the remaining data.'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Use the function mean(), with na.rm = TRUE, to find the mean age of students in the dataframe.'
  CorrectAnswer: mean(TDM$age, na.rm = TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'mean(TDM$age, na.rm = TRUE)')
  Hint: 'Call the function mean() on the age column in TDM by entering the following into console: mean(TDM$age, na.rm = TRUE)'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'We now know how to index columns in a dataframe using the $ operator. But what if we want to select just some rows in that column?'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'To index partial columns, we will use hard brackets []. Inside the hard brackets, we will tell R which part of the column we want to index.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'Usually, when we want to index partial dataframe columns, we only want parts of the column that satisfy some conditions.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'For example, what if we want to index only the class years for all participants who are older than 21 years?'

- Class: text
  Output: 'We would use the command TDM$class[TDM$age > 21] . Inside the hard brackets, we have entered a logical statement.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'This works because in our dataframe, each row contains the data for a single participant. This means that every value of "class" belongs to the same participant as the value of "age" in the corresponding row of the dataframe.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'Thus, we can index partial dataframe columns using logical statements about the values of other columns.'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'For logical statements on numeric columns, we can use the following operators:'

- Class: text
  Output: '== (is equal to), != (is not equal to)'

- Class: text
  Output: '> (greater than), >= (greater than or equal to)'
  
- Class: text
  Output: '< (less than), <= (less than or equal to)'

- Class: text
  Output: 'For logical statements on text columns, we can use the following operators:'

- Class: text
  Output: '== , != . These will check if the string (piece of character data) on the left is equal to the string on the right or not.'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'For example, TDM$courses_enrolled[TDM$gender == "F"] will index all the values of enrolled courses for female gender students.'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'Notice that for character data, you need to have quotation marks around the data (e.g. "F") so that R knows that you''re referring to character data.'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Use hard brackets and a logical statement to index the school affiliations of all left-handed participants.'
  CorrectAnswer: TDM$school[TDM$handed == "L"]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'TDM$school[TDM$handed == "L"]')
  Hint: 'Call the school column of TDM, and then hard-bracket index it, with a logical statement on the inside selecting all values of the handedness column corresponding to left-handers.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'Now, let''s calculate some descriptive statistics on our data! For the next set of questions, each question will have two parts.'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'The first part will ask you to type in the correct code to calculate a particular descriptive statistic.'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'The second part will ask you to type in the correct value of the descriptive statistic. You can enter the number that is output by the answer to the first part of the question to answer the second part of the question.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'In our dataframe, we will calculate each participant''s score on the "Regret Scale" (Schwartz et al., 2002) by averaging the scores on each of 5 different questions: regret1, regret2, regret3, regret4, and regret5.'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'We can use the function rowMeans() to calculate the mean value for every row of a dataframe.'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'Then, we''ll assign the output of rowMeans() to a new column in TDM so we can keep everyone''s Regret Scale scores with all of their other data.'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Run the following command to calculate the mean Regret Scale score from the 5 questions: TDM$regret_total <- rowMeans(cbind(TDM$regret1, TDM$regret2, TDM$regret3, TDM$regret4, TDM$regret5))'
