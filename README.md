R assignments for Katherine Fox-Glassman's methods course in the Columbia psychology dept

## Stuff to know

These assignments are currently being rebuilt in [Swirl](https://swirlstats.com/), which creates lessons that run interactively through console and check students' console input for correctness.

To edit these, you must have `swirl` and `swirlify` installed for R. Call `library(swirlify)` at the beginning of your R session to load the lesson editing tools.

You can either edit the relevant lesson.yaml file to add lesson content, or use the `swirlify` Shiny app to edit the lesson through the GUI.
