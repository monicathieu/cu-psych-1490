- Class: text
  Output: 'Any text after a # is not read by R until a carriage return. (a carriage return is a new line)'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'If you want to make notes for yourself, put them after a #.'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'RStudio shows this kind of "comment text" in another color.'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'Tip: To comment multiple lines of code, highlight them and type ctrl[/command] + shift + C. Anything that''s on its own (un-commented) line will get run.'

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 2 + 2 to see what R calculates for the answer.
  CorrectAnswer: 2 + 2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='2 + 2')
  Hint: Type a hint.
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'First we want to tell R where to find the data files we''ll be using.'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Ask R "what is the current working directory?" by calling the function getwd()'
  CorrectAnswer: getwd()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'getwd()')
  Hint: Type getwd() into your console, and press Enter to run it and see what it tells you.

- Class: text
  Output: 'You should see a file path as the output of getwd(). This tells you the folder on your computer that R is currently "inside".'

- Class: text
  Output: 'Before working with data, we need to read it into R''s environment.'

- Class: text
  Output: First, make sure you know where the dataset is saved. It should be in the your current working directory, and saved in .csv format.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Ask R to show you all the files in your current working directory by calling the function list.files()
  CorrectAnswer: list.files()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'list.files()')
  Hint: Type list.files() into your console, and press Enter to run it and see what it tells you.

- Class: text
  Output: 'You should see a series of file names in the output. Make sure there is a file that ends in .csv, as that''s the data file we''ll be loading.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'We''ll use the function read.csv() to read data from this CSV file into R.'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'We need to tell read.csv() which file we want to read data from. We will do this by putting the name of the file inside the parentheses of read.csv() so that it knows where to look for the data.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'We also need to tell R to store the info from the file in an R object so we can work with the data.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'We''ll do this using the left-arrow operator, <- , to take the data on the RIGHT side, and save it into the label name on the LEFT side.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'Then, whenever we want to access the data, we just need to tell R the label name and the data will be there.'

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Read this CSV data file into R by entering the following command: TDM <- read.csv("classdata_2017.csv")'
  CorrectAnswer: TDM <- read.csv("classdata_2017.csv")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'TDM <- read.csv("classdata_2017.csv")')
  Hint: 'Copy the following command and press Enter to run: TDM <- read.csv("classdata_2017.csv")'

- Class: text
  Output: 'We just read in the data saved in classdata_2017.csv, and used the left arrow <- to assign that data to the label TDM.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'R is case sensitive, so the label tdm is not the same as the label TDM.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'Our convention will be to label data frames with capital letters, and variables in lowercase.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'Next, we''ll learn about functions that help you explore your data. Sometimes, you''ll use these to make sure your data read in correctly, and sometimes you''ll use these simply to inspect your data so you know what''s in it.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'The first exploring function you''ll use is str().'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'str() tells you the following things about an object:'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'the type of object that TDM is'

- Class: text
  Output: 'the number of observations and number of variables (dimensions) of TDM'

- Class: text
  Output: 'a list of each variable and its class (TDMerval, factor, numeric, etc.)'

- Class: text
  Output: 'for each variable, a list of all values'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Enter the following command and inspect the output: str(TDM)'
  CorrectAnswer: str(TDM)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'str(TDM)')
  Hint: 'Copy the following command and press Enter to run: str(TDM)'

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Does str() tell you the names of the columns in a dataframe?
  AnswerChoices: Yes; No
  CorrectAnswer: Yes
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'Yes')
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Does str() tell you the data types of the columns in a dataframe?
  AnswerChoices: Yes; No
  CorrectAnswer: Yes
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'Yes')
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Does str() tell you how many rows are in a dataframe?
  AnswerChoices: Yes; No
  CorrectAnswer: Yes
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'Yes')
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'The next exploring function you''ll use is head().'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'head() prints out the first few rows of a dataframe, so you can peek at what the data look like.'
